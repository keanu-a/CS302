# Assignment 1: Bubble Sort on a doubly linked list

## Description
Sorting. One of the celebrated topics in computer science and which we will spend quite a bit of time during
the earlier part of the semester. You will implement bubble sort, probably the first sorting algorithm to
which you were introduced back in CS135. Except we will use a linked list and use iterators just to give you
a very pleasant welcome to CS302. The next section goes over the data type you will need to implement.

## Sample Run
```
Enter file with list: small.txt
Original List
10 5 9 3 7 12 2 4 11 1

Sorted List
1 2 3 4 5 7 9 10 11 12
```
